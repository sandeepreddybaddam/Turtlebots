# Turtlebots

code repository for vision-based autonomous tracking and platooning

# move forward 
-- contain codes using odometry

# vision 
-- contain codes for platooning using vision

For vision, Intel Realsense d435 camera is used
Also contains,
1. Path planning using Feedback linearization
2. Obstacle avoidance algorithm using LiDAR and camera

PushButtonPlot refers to:
  User Interface for PID simulation
  Objective: Making the bot move in a straight line
